### Note
The `.sql` version only contains 3000 rows for the `stream.csv` file, and 3001 rows for the `chat.csv` file; therefore, the data visualization is different than the `.ipynb` file which contains 526299 rows for the `stream.csv`, and 148562 rows for the `chat.csv`.

Also, the `.sql` version is the intended project, while the `.ipynb` version was done using my own time and research.
