### Note:

If the [Jupyter Notebook's version of the Netflix Project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/python/projects/portfolio_project/netflix_movies_tv_project%20(1).ipynb) does not load properly, I have included a [PDF version of the project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/python/projects/portfolio_project/netflix_movies_tv_project.pdf), and I've gone ahead and the [Python file of the project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/python/projects/portfolio_project/netflix_movies_tv_project.py) as well; however, the Python file does not include the graphs.
