### Note:

If the [Jupyter Notebook's version of the Binding of Isaac Project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/data_analysis/projects/binding_of_isaac_project.ipynb) does not load properly, I have included a [PDF version of the project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/data_analysis/projects/Binding%20of%20Isaac%20Project.pdf), and a [Python file of the project](https://github.com/jeyla380/codecademy_projects/blob/main/datascience/data_analysis/projects/binding_of_isaac_project.py) as well; however, the Python file does not include the graphs.
